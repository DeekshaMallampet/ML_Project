# 🚗 Car Price Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

## Introduction
Car pricing is a crucial aspect of the automobile industry, influenced by multiple factors like engine specifications, fuel type, and body style. This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict car prices based on various attributes. By analyzing historical data, we aim to build an **accurate and interpretable pricing model** that can be leveraged by car dealers, buyers, and data analysts.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
✅ Understand the relationship between **vehicle attributes and price**.
✅ Build a **predictive model** that estimates car prices accurately.
✅ Compare multiple regression techniques to determine the **best-performing model**.
✅ Provide insights into the **most influential features** affecting car prices.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
📌 **Dataset**: `CarPrice_Assignment.csv`
📌 **Attributes**: The dataset consists of various specifications such as:
   - **Numerical Features**: Engine size, horsepower, curb weight, compression ratio, fuel efficiency.
   - **Categorical Features**: Fuel type, car body style, engine location, number of doors.
📌 **Target Variable**: `price` (car price in USD).

## 🔄 Data Processing Pipeline
### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
🔹 Checked for **missing values** and handled them appropriately.
🔹 Extracted **brand** and **model** from the `CarName` column for better analysis.
🔹 Encoded categorical variables using **Label Encoding**.
🔹 Removed unnecessary columns such as `CarName`.

### **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
📊 Visualized numerical data distributions to check for **skewness and outliers**.
📊 Generated **correlation heatmaps** to identify relationships between features.
📊 Analyzed **categorical variables** using count plots to understand their distribution.
📊 Found that **engine size, horsepower, and curb weight** have the strongest impact on price.

### **Step 3: Feature Engineering & Scaling**
🔹 Introduced **brand-based features** to capture additional insights.
🔹 Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical variables, ensuring uniform scaling across different attributes.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models Used
We trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to determine the most effective approach for price prediction:

📌 **Linear Regression** - Basic model to establish a baseline.
📌 **Lasso Regression** - Helps in feature selection by shrinking coefficients of less relevant features.
📌 **Ridge Regression** - Regularized model to reduce overfitting.
📌 **Decision Tree Regression** - Captures non-linear relationships effectively.
📌 **Random Forest Regression** - An ensemble model that improves accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

## 📊 Model Evaluation & Comparison
We used the following metrics to assess model performance:
✅ **R-squared (R²) Score**: Measures how well the model explains price variations.
✅ **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Evaluates the accuracy of price predictions.
✅ **Performance Summary Table**: Created a comparison table to rank models based on their effectiveness.

📈 **Best Model**: Random Forest Regression achieved the highest R² score, making it the most accurate predictor.
